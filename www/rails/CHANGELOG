*0.8.0 (15)*

* Removed custom_table_name option for new_model now that the Inflector is as powerful as it is

* Changed the default rake action to just do testing and separate API generation and coding statistics into a "doc" task.

* Fixed WEBrick dispatcher to handle missing slashes in the URLs gracefully [alexey]

* Added user option for all postgresql tool calls in the rakefile [elvstone]

* Fixed problem with running "ruby public/dispatch.servlet" instead of "cd public; ruby dispatch.servlet" [alexey]

* Fixed WEBrick server so that it no longer hardcodes the ruby interpreter used to "ruby" but will get the one used based
  on the Ruby runtime configuration. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Fixed Dispatcher so it'll route requests to magic_beans to MagicBeansController/magic_beans_controller.rb [Caio Chassot]

* "new_controller MagicBeans" and "new_model SubscriptionPayments" will now both behave properly as they use the new Inflector.

* Fixed problem with MySQL foreign key constraint checks in Rake :clone_production_structure_to_test target [Andreas Schwarz]

* Changed WEBrick server to by default be auto-reloading, which is slower but makes source changes instant.
  Class compilation cache can be turned on with "-c" or "--cache-classes".

* Added "-b/--binding" option to WEBrick dispatcher to bind the server to a specific IP address (default: 127.0.0.1) [Kevin Temp]

* dispatch.fcgi now DOESN'T set FCGI_PURE_RUBY as it was slowing things down for now reason [Andreas Schwarz]

* Added new_mailer generator to work with Action Mailer

* Included new framework: Action Mailer 0.3

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.9.0

* Upgraded to Active Record 1.0.0


*0.7.0*

* Added an optional second argument to the new_model script that allows the programmer to specify the table name, 
  which will used to generate a custom table_name method in the model and will also be used in the creation of fixtures.
  [Kevin Radloff]

* script/new_model now turns AccountHolder into account_holder instead of accountholder [Kevin Radloff]

* Fixed the faulty handleing of static files with WEBrick [Andreas Schwarz]

* Unified function_test_helper and unit_test_helper into test_helper

* Fixed bug with the automated production => test database dropping on PostgreSQL [dhawkins]

* create_fixtures in both the functional and unit test helper now turns off the log during fixture generation
  and can generate more than one fixture at a time. Which makes it possible for assignments like:
  
    @people, @projects, @project_access, @companies, @accounts = 
      create_fixtures "people", "projects", "project_access", "companies", "accounts"

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.8.5 (locally-scoped variables, partials, advanced send_file)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.5 (better table_name guessing, cloning, find_all_in_collection)


*0.6.5*

* No longer specifies a template for rdoc, so it'll use whatever is default (you can change it in the rakefile)

* The new_model generator will now use the same rules for plural wordings as Active Record 
  (so Category will give categories, not categorys) [Kevin Radloff]

* dispatch.fcgi now sets FCGI_PURE_RUBY to true to ensure that it's the Ruby version that's loaded [danp]

* Made the GEM work with Windows

* Fixed bug where mod_ruby would "forget" the load paths added when switching between controllers

* PostgreSQL are now supported for the automated production => test database dropping [Kevin Radloff]

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.8.0 (lots and lots and lots of fixes)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.4 (a bunch of fixes)


*0.6.0*

* Added AbstractionApplicationController as a superclass for all controllers generated. This class can be used
  to carry filters and methods that are to be shared by all. It has an accompanying ApplicationHelper that all
  controllers will also automatically have available.

* Added environments that can be included from any script to get the full Active Record and Action Controller
  context running. This can be used by maintenance scripts or to interact with the model through IRB. Example:
  
    require 'config/environments/production'
    
    for account in Account.find_all
      account.recalculate_interests
    end
  
  A short migration script for an account model that had it's interest calculation strategy changed.

* Accessing the index of a controller with "/weblog" will now redirect to "/weblog/" (only on Apache, not WEBrick)

* Simplified the default Apache config so even remote requests are served off CGI as a default.
  You'll now have to do something specific to activate mod_ruby and FCGI (like using the force urls).
  This should make it easier for new comers that start on an external server.

* Added more of the necessary Apache options to .htaccess to make it easier to setup

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.9 (lots of fixes)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.3 (lots of fixes)


*0.5.7*

* Fixed bug in the WEBrick dispatcher that prevented it from getting parameters from the URL
  (through GET requests or otherwise)

* Added lib in root as a place to store app specific libraries

* Added lib and vendor to load_path, so anything store within can be loaded directly. 
  Hence lib/redcloth.rb can be loaded with require "redcloth"

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.8 (lots of fixes)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.2 (minor upgrade)


*0.5.6*

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.7 (multipart form fix)

* Updated the generated template stubs to valid XHTML files

* Ensure that controllers generated are capitalized, so "new_controller TodoLists" 
  gives the same as "new_controller Todolists" and "new_controller todolists".


*0.5.5*

* Works on Windows out of the box! (Dropped symlinks)

* Added webrick dispatcher: Try "ruby public/dispatch.servlet --help" [Florian Gross]
