# karting
An emulated game server for LittleBigPlanet™Karting and ModNation®Racers on the PS3®. Look at the `www` (public server directory) folder for documentation about the server and files. This project is made for the PHP7+ programming language running on Apache 2.4+.

## How to Connect
All types of PS3 systems will be able to connect (regardless if it's CEX, DEX, CFW, HAN, HEN). The server is in its prototype phase therefore instructions will be made once it's actually playable and ready to be publicly tested.

*Estimate* public testing: December 1999.
