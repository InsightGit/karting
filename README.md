# karting
An emulated game server for LittleBigPlanet™Karting and ModNation®Racers on the PS3®. Look at the `www` (public server directory) folder for documentation.

## How to Connect
All types of PS3 systems will be able to connect (regardless if it's HAN, HEN, CFW, DEX). The server is in its prototype phase therefore instructions will be made once it's actually playable.
